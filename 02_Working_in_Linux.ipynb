    "<h1><center>Module 02: Working in a Linux Environment: Cluster Computer Architecture</center></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is largely focussed on building an understanding of the fundamental components of cluster computer architectures and establishing a common computing framework for working on Mines computer clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many scientific/geophysical problems require computing power and storage that is beyond what is available on a single computer. In such cases, scientists often parallelize their algorithms (i.e., divide the task into smaller chunks) and run smaller jobs on multiple computers simultaneously. This module introduces the computing resources available for students at Mines and shows  how students can access and utilize these resources to speed up their large-scale jobs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux is the most popular operating system for a growing number of scientific applications, especially in geophysics. Therefore, familiarity with Linux will be advantageous throughout your career as a geophysicist, especially when dealing with large-scale numerical problems that require high-performance computing solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux offers a free operating system. Being open-source, anybody with programming knowledge can modify it. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being a free operating system, Linux is also a great platform for programming and supports almost all programming languages people use in geophysical computing. It offers free powerful tools ranging from simple text editors to powerful integrated development environments (IDE). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Linux commands\n",
    "Even though many Linux distros come with a GUI, we usually interact with Linux computers through a terminal. Here, we will remember/learn some of the terminal commands for the most frequent tasks we perform on our computers: creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing directories\n",
    "If you want to change your current directory, use the **'cd'** command. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top level directory on any Linux system is the root directory. It contains all other directories and is designated by a forward slash **'/'**. Hence, every path in Linux starts with the **'/'** symbol (e.g., /home/tugrul).\n",
    "\n",
    "```linux\n",
    "cd /home/tugrul\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To navigate up one directory, use **'cd ..'**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/linux_dirstr.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**<center>Figure 1. An example Linux directory structure.</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Present Working Directory\n",
    "It is always useful to know where you are. You can determine the directory you are currently browsing by typing the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing files in a directory\n",
    "To see the list of files in your current directory, use the **'ls'** command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "ls -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copying files\n",
    "you can use the **'cp'** command to copy files on a Linux system. For example, **'cp /home/tugrul/main.c 'home/jeff/main_copy.c'** copies the **'main.c'** file in the **'/home/tugrul/'** directory to **'/home/jeff/'** directory and saves with the name **'main_copy.c'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating directories\n",
    "On a Linux operating system, directories can be created with the **'mkdir directory'** command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting files and directories\n",
    "Files and directories can be deleted using the **'rm'** command. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to delete a file, you can type\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rm filename_to_be_deleted\n",
    "```\n",
    "When deleting directories, you have two options. The first one is a variant of the **rm** command, but for directories\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rmdir directory_you_want_to_delete\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can provide the **\"recursive\"** option to the **rm** command to delete a directory and everything inside it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rm -r directory_you_want_to_delete\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving/Renaming files and directories\n",
    "Files and directories can be moved and renamed using the **'mv'** command. \n",
    "\n",
    "To rename a directory or file, try \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mv old_filename new_filename\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and using aliases\n",
    "A shell alias is a shortcut to reference a command. Instead of writing long commands every time, you can create short aliases that are shorter and easier to write. The standard syntax for creating alias is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "alias shortname=\"your custom command here\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A good use of aliases for your case is when accesing the Mio cluster. Instead of typing\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh -Y username@mio.mines.edu\n",
    "```   \n",
    "\n",
    "each time you want to connect to Mio, you can create an alias such that\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "alias mio=\"ssh -Y username@mio.mines.edu\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make aliases permanent, you need to put that into your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another good use of aliases is to avoid typing error when using Madagascar. You can alias the common spelling mistakes for the **scons** command to ensure that it will work most of the time without requiring a correction. An example is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# scons aliases\n",
    "alias scosn=\"scons\"\n",
    "alias scson=\"scons\"\n",
    "alias csosn=\"scons\"\n",
    "alias scns=\"scons\"\n",
    "alias sconsc=\"scons -c\"\n",
    "alias sconscv=\"scons -c; scons view\"\n",
    "alias sconscs=\"scons -c; scons\"\n",
    "alias sconscv=\"scons -c; scons view\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### top\n",
    "On Linux systems, the **top** command shows the Linux processes. It provides a dynamic real-time view of the running system. \n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as you will run this command, you will see an interactive command mode where the top half oprtion will contains the statistics of processes and the system resource usage. And the lower half shows a list of the currently running processes. To exit from this window, you just need to press the *q* button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Piping in linux\n",
    "A pipe is a form of redirection used on Linux-based systems to send the output of one command, program, or process to to another command, program, or process as input for further processing.You can connect programs by piping using the pipe character **\"|\"**. The syntax is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | ... | commanc_N\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### grep\n",
    "The grep command searches file for a particular pattern of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern. For instance, in a directory with so many files, you can list all the files thath contain the word \"apple\" by just typing the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ls -l | grep apple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the **ls -l** command lists all the files in the current directory and sends all the listed file names to the **grep** command through pipe. The **grep** program then lists only the file names that contain the word \"apple\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The **grep** command is by default case sensitive. Howeverm you can force it to make a case-insensitive search by adding the **-i** option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### find\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the **find** command find files on your Linux system. If used with the right arguments/options, find command is very powerful. The standard syntax is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "find directory_to_search -name \"file_name_to_be_found\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not limited to search for files only using their names. In addition, you can also search for directories. Here are some examples on how you can search files on Linux platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Find all file in the entire system that are names \"test.txt\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "find / -name \"test.txt\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Find all directories in the system  called \"log\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "find / -type d -name \"log\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Find all files in the \"/usr/bin\" directory of subdirectories that are larger than 1 megabyte:\n",

    "## What is a cluster?\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, real-life three-dimensional geophysical problems are much larger than a single laptop or computer can handle. In such cases, we inherently need to utilize more computers to have enough computing power and memory to be able to solve the problem at hand within a reasonable time frame. Luckily, in many universities, companies, and national labs, there are large-scale computing systems that are really just collection of computers that work together to solve problems larger than any one computer can solve. These cluster of computers are often interchangably called **\"clusters\"**, **\"supercomputers\"** or resources for **\"high-performance computing (HPC)\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The individual computers in a **cluster** are often referred to as **\"nodes\"**. And, just as we, people, need to talk to each other in order to collaborate, nodes in a cluster also need to be able to talk to one another; hence nodes in a cluster are connected together with a computer network (often referred to as interconnect).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like your laptop or desktop computers, the fundamental components of each node in a cluster are nothing but processors, memory, disks, and so on. The primary difference is the scale: nodes in clusters usually have faster processors, more memory, and more storage. And, just like your personal computer, each nodes needs an operating system to be able to function properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, computer clusters are widely used by many institutions, companies and labs.

    "## The anatomy of a Computer Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer clusters often include several different types of nodes, which are used for different purposes. **Master** or **Head** nodes are where you login to interact with the HPC system. master node is also the place to  download/retrieve data from HPC to your local computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Compute** nodes are where the actual heavy computing takes place. In a typical cluster setup, user usually cannot access compute nodes directly as access to these nodes are generally controlled by a scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/hpc.png\" width=\"500\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<center>Figure 4. A high-level overview of a computer cluster.</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nodes\n",
    "Each node in a cluster is an individual computer with its processor and memory. Modern processors contain multiple cores that are responsible for the actual computations. In addition, there are various fast memory caches for holding the data that is currently being worked on. On the CSM Mio system, nodes have 8 or 28 cores. Often, nodes in cluster have multiple processors, which effectively doubles the number of cores per node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node also has a certain amount of random access memory (RAM) available. on Mio, each compute node has 24 or 256 GB of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, each node has access to a disk (also called \"storage\" or \"file system\") that is usually shared among all nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/node.png\" width=\"500\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<center>Figure 4. A typical node scheme.</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "Usually problems people work on clusters are huge and involves many large files. In addition, these files have to be accessible from all nodes available on the system. Hence, most cluster have specialized file systems that are designed to meet these needs. Often, these file systems are intended to be used only for short- or medium-term storage. As a consequence, HPC systems may have several different file systems available, each serving for a different purpose (e.g., home and scratch file systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color=red>DO NOT PUT THE ONLY COPY OF YOUR SOURCE CODE TO SCRATCH!</font>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scheduler\n",
    "Computer clusters are usually shared by many users and it is common to allocate subsets of resources to different tasks. To manage the sharing of available resources amoing all of the jobs, HPC systems usually use a scheduler. Users generally, login to the master node and submit their jobs through a scheduler which runs the computation on the compute nodes. Often, schedulers decide which job to run first based on their priority that is usually assigned by users or the administrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Memory\n",
    "The individual CPU-cores can be put together to form large parallel machines in two fundemantally different ways: the shared and distributed memory architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to consider regarding the terms shared memory and distributed memory: in terms of how the hardware actually implemented, and what do they mean in as programming abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a strictly hardware point of view, we see a typical shared-memory architecture where all processors can access to a common physical memory. If you have multiple processors, then those would be able to access exactly the same memory locations (see Figure 5). This architecture is very similar to what you have in your personal computers. Hence, developing high-performance parallel algorithms for shared-memory systems is straightforward and very similar to developing serial applications that you would normally run on your laptop. However, there are two big problems with this approach: 1) building CPUs with hundred thousands of cores is not possible for now; 2) all CPU-cores compete for access to memory over a shared bus. That's this kind of systems are not manufactured today. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the idea of communicating directly through memory remains a useful programming abstraction. So in many systems, programmers use common programming techniques (e.g., OpenMP) to perform parallel tasks can directly access the same **\"virtual\"** memory regardless of where the physical memory actually exists. So, this programming model can be thought as an illusion that all memory is actually shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/shared_mem.png\" width=\"500\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<center>Figure 5. Shared memory architecture.</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed Memory \n",
    "\n",
    "From hardwave point of view, in distributed memory systems, processors perform computations on their local memory and use networks to transfer data with remote processors. Although this model greatly simplifies the hardware implementation, the programming for these platforms becomes more complex as programmers also has to take of the communication between the processors in addition to actual computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the shared memory case, distributed memory can also be used as a programming model and CPU-cores can be forced to communicate through the network and behave like they are accessing their local memory even though they actually see the same common memory. So, you can use your CPU cores on your laptop as if they are on different machines.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Setting up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because HPC systems serve many users with different software needs, HPC systems often have multiple versions of commonly used software packages installed. Since you cannot easily install and use different versions of a package at the same time without causing potential issues, HPC systems often use environment modules (often shortened to modules) that allow you to configure your software environment with the particular versions of software that you need. \n",

    "Version control systems are commonly used by professional programmers. So many times, you will change something in your program and everything will stop running. Or, you may accidentally delete your source code and may have to face catastrophic consequences. To avoid all these problems, it is crucial to be aware of the availability of the version control systems and to use them regularly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git is the msot commonly used version control system, It tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.

    "## A really brief introduction to C\n",
    "\n",
    "C is a general-purpose programming language that was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style. These features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development as well as scientific programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The C language program can be modeled as a state machine. The state is defined by the values assigned to the variables declared in the program. The program code specifies how its state should change during program execution, which can be made by four fundamental primitives: assignment, sequential composition, branching, and loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The structure of a C program\n",
    "\n",
    "Any program in C can be written in the structure given below. Often, you will need to use more advanced programming concepts such as functions to improve the readability and repeatability of your code. We will see and use some of these concepts in examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a typical C program is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/c_structure.png\" width=\"500\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**<center>Figure 7. Structure of a C program.</center>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of the above structure are explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Including header files\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a C program, the first thing you do is to include the Header files. A header file is a file with extension **\".h\"**, and contains C function declarations and definitions. Some of the useful header files are\n",
    "\n",
    "* stdio.h  - contains core input and output functions\n",
    "* stdlib.h - provides functions for mathematical computations, I/O, memory management, and several other OS services.\n",
    "* math.h   - defines common mathematical functions \n",
    "* string.h - containt functions for string manipulation operations\n",
    "* time.h    - contains functions related to date and time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax to include a header file in C:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <headerfile.h>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main method declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "Every C program has to have a main function. This is the starting point of your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax to declare the main function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{}    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable declaration\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the first part of your main function is variable declaration. Here, you define the names and types of the variables that you will use later in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can find an example of defining a floating point variable (declared using the **float** keyword in C) named \"apple\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    float apple;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code (Body) of the program\n",
    "\n",
    "Body of a C program refers to the operations that are performed in the program. It can be anything like manipulations, mathematical operations, or printing the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can see an example where the program writes the value of an integer variable named \"dontdothis\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    int dontdothis;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    dontdothis = 8;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    printf(\"%d\", dontdothis);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The return statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part of any C program is the return statement. In C  language, the **return** statement refers to the the returning values from a function. the return statement and the return value depend on the return type of the function. For example,  the function returns an integer number, which is by the ***int*** keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int main()\n",
    "{\n",
    "    float a;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    printf(\"%f\",a);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases when the return type of a C function os **void**, there will be no return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, computer programs are also meant to be read by other people. To help others understand the code one should describe using plain language what it does and any assumptions the code relies on. Such descriptions are are called **comments** in computer programming and can be written in two ways in C language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a single line comment, you can use\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// this is a comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you will need write long explanations in your code. In such cases, you may want to use more than one line. You can add multiline comments in C as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "/* This is short a comment */\n",
    "\n",
    "/* \n",
    "But,\n",
    "can\n",
    "be \n",
    "a \n",
    "long\n",
    "one\n",
    "if\n",
    "you\n",
    "want\n",
    "!\n",
    "*/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing your first C program\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know the main components of a C program, we can go ahead follow the biggest cliche in computer programming: writing the infamous \"Hello, World\" program. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the source code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "/*\n",
    " * First C program that says Hello (hello.c)\n",
    " */\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>  // Needed to perform IO operations\n",
    " \n",
    "int main() \n",
    "{                    // Program entry point\n",
    "    printf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");  // Says Hello\n",
    "    return 0;                   // Terminate main()\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "C is a compiled language. So, your source code needs to be converted to a form that the computer hardware can understand. We use compilers for this purpose. \"gcc\" is the standard compiler for C that comes with Linux. To compiler your C code with gcc, you can use the gcc compiler as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gcc -o binary_name source_file.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To compile and execute the Hello, Word program, just write the code above to a file named **\"hello.c\"** and compile your program as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gcc -o hello hello.c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the program, simply type\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "./hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays in C\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, World program is exciting! However, you often will want to write something more useful such as finding out the average of 100 integer numbers. In this case, you have two ways to do this: 1) Define 100 variables with int data type to store the values in the variables and then calculate the average of them. 2) Have a single integer array to store all the values, loop the array to calculate the average. Obviously as in the second solution, it is more  convenient to store same data types in one single variable and later access them using array index.\n",
    "\n",
    "An array in the C language represents **fixed** size sequences of values of the same type. An array variable is defined by the type of the values it contains and its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the code below declares an array variable called \"point\" which contains 3 integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    float point[3];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the elements of an array in C using the array index between square brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    float mydata[20];\n",
    "\n",
    "    mydata[0] /* first element of the mydata array */\n",
    "    mydata[19] /* last (20th) element of the mydata array */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create multidimensional arrays in C. For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "float x[3][4];    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, **x** is a two-dimensional (2D) array with 3 rows and each row has 4 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/2darray.jpg\" width=\"500\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can initialize a 2D array in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    /* each {} is a row */\n",
    "    int c[2][3] = {{1, 3, 0},{-1, 5, 9}}; \n",
    "    \n",
    "    /* 2 rows and 3 columns= we have a total of 6 elements */\n",
    "    int c[2][3] = {1, 3, 0,-1, 5, 9}; \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### for loop in C programming\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most frequently used loop in C programming. The syntax of for loop is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    for (initialization; condition test; increment or decrement)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        // statements to be executed repeatedly\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you can see an example C program that writes integer number from 3 to 7:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    #include<stdio.h>\n",
    "    int main()\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        int i;\n",
    "        for (i=3; i<=7; i++) /* in C, i++ is equal to i=i+1 */\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            printf (\"%d \\n\", i);\n",
    "        }\n",
    "        return 0;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially when solving multidimensional problems, you will often need nested for loops. You can find an example of a nested for loop below\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)\n",
    "    {\n",

    "         * i = 0, j = 0\n",
    "         * i = 0, j = 1        \n",
    "         * i = 1, j = 0\n",
    "         * i = 1, j = 1\n",
    "        */\n",
    "    }      \n",
    "}    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditional branching in C (if ... if else)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you will need to execute a block of code only when a given condition is true or false. In such cases, you can use the **\"if\"** statements as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    if (condition)\n",
    "    {\n",
    "     // block of C statements here\n",
    "     // these statements will only be executed if the condition is true\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Example C program to find out the average of 4 integers\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",
    "int main()\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are quite useful, but as you might have realized, we need to know their size before compiling our programs so that the compiler can allocate the memory required to store those arrays. However, in real-life situations, sizes of arrays you will use in your programs will vary depending on the size of the data you are processing. C language provides some functionality to dynamically allocate arrays whose size can be decided during the runtime. Before, we will be able to utilize that functionality, however, we need to understand a very famous programming concept: pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in your programs, you assigned values to your variables, and performed some mathematical operations to change/use those values. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    int a = 5;\n",
    "    int b;\n",
    "\n",
    "    b = a*a;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in C, you can access other properties of variables such the address of the memory location that variable is being stored. To do that, we use the **\"&\"** operator before the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example program that writes both the value and the address of an integer variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include <stdio.h>\n",

    "In the program above, we have a variable num of int type. The value of num is 10 and this value must be stored somewhere in the memory. Whenever you define a variable, a memory space is allocated to store the value of that variable. And, same as our house has an address, these memory locations also have their addresses. The **\"&\"** symbol simply shows us that address. Then, we can ask an important question: can we define a variable that keeps the address of another variable? The answer is yes, and we call such variables as **pointers** in C programming language.\n",
